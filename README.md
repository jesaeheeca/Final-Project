We will be working with the College Scorecard Dataset, specifically scorecard data and post-school earnings, collected by the US Department of Education and accessed at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/. 

This project should be used as a tool for parents and high school students to make college decisions on the basis of the financial success of past students who attended universities of interest.

This project will answer three questions. 

1. Which top 5 schools in a given state have the highest median household income?
2. Which top 5 schools in a given state have the highest mean earnings of independent students working and not enrolled 10 years after entry?
3. What is the percentage of degree types awarded in a given school?
