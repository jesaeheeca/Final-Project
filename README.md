This project should be used as a tool for parents and high school students to make college decisions.

We will be working with the College Scorecard Dataset, specifically scorecard data and post-school earnings, collected by the US Department of Education and accessed at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

This project will answer three questions.
